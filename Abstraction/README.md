This program demonstrates the concept of abstraction using Python's abc (Abstract Base Class) module. It highlights how abstract classes can be used to define a blueprint for other classes, and how specific details can be provided in subclasses.

Abstract Class (Animal):

The Animal class is defined as an abstract class by inheriting from ABC. It includes an abstract method sound(), which does not have an implementation in the abstract class itself. This method acts as a placeholder, enforcing that any subclass must provide its own implementation of sound().

Concrete Classes (Dog and Cat):

The Dog and Cat classes inherit from the abstract Animal class and implement the sound() method. Each class provides a specific implementation of sound():

The Dog class returns "Bark".

The Cat class returns "Meow".

Attempting to Create an Abstract Object:

The program illustrates that you cannot directly instantiate an abstract class (i.e., Animal). Attempting to create an object of the Animal class (e.g., animal = Animal()) will result in a TypeError, because abstract methods have not been implemented yet.

Demonstrating Polymorphism:

The program demonstrates polymorphism by calling the sound() method on objects of both the Dog and Cat classes, resulting in different outputs (Bark and Meow respectively), based on the actual object type.
