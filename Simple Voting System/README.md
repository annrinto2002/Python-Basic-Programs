Write a Python program that simulates a simple voting system. The program should:
1.	Ask the user to enter their age.
2.	If the user is 18 years or older, display a message that they are eligible to vote.
3.	Allow the user to cast a vote for a political party by entering the party name.
o	Acceptable party names are: LDF, UDF, BJP.
o	The input should be case-insensitive, and the program should convert it to uppercase before checking.
o	If the entered party is valid, display a message: "Vote Cast. Thank You!"
o	If the entered party is not valid, display: "Invalid Party"
4.	If the user is under 18, display a message that they are not eligible to vote.
