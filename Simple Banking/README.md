Write a Python program to simulate a simple bank account transaction system.

The user should first enter the initial balance amount in the account.

Then, allow the user to perform multiple transactions:

Deposit money into the account.

Withdraw money from the account.

After each transaction, display the updated balance.

The program should continue to prompt the user for transactions until the user chooses to stop.

If the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance, display an appropriate message.
