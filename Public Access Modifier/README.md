This program demonstrates the use of the public access modifier in Python. In Python, all class members (attributes and methods) are public by default, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.

> Key Features:

Class Definition (Employee):

The class has two public attributes: name and salary.

It also includes a public method show_details() that prints employee details.

> Object Creation:

An Employee object is created with the name "Jhon" and salary 5000.

> Accessing Public Members:

The attributes name and salary are accessed and printed outside the class using the object.

The method show_details() is also called using the object.
