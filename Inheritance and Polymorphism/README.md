Create a base class Vehicle with attributes brand and model, and a method display_info() that prints these details.Then, create three derived classes:

    Car 
    
    Bike 
    
    Truck 

Each derived class should override display_info() to include additional details:

    Car should include number of doors 


    Bike should include engine capacity (in cc) 


    Truck should include load capacity (in tons) 

Tasks:

    Implement all the classes with proper inheritance. 

    Create objects for each vehicle type and call display_info().
